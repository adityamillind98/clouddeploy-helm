# Cloud Deploy with Helm

This repo contains some example assets to evaluate how to use [Google Cloud Deploy](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/overview) to manage software delivery through 2 environments: QA and Prod, using Helm Charts to customize the application for each environment.

The [skaffold.yaml](skaffold.yaml) configuration file contained in this repo overrides the Helm Chart values so that the application will have 1 replica in the QA environment and 3 in Prod.


## Preparation



1. Create 2 GKE Clusters, one for the qa environment and the other for the prod environment.
2. Create / have available an [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) Repository to store your images
3. Create a Cloud Deploy [delivery pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application#creating_your_delivery_pipeline) that has qa and prod as stages each using a profile with the same name ([here an example manifest](clouddeploy-config/delivery-pipeline.yaml))
4. Create 2 Cloud Deploy targets mapping the above clusters to the pipeline stages (here example manifests for [qa](clouddeploy-config/target-qa.yaml) and [prod](clouddeploy-config/target-prod.yaml), that needs to be customized with your cluster names, project and locations)


## Execution



1. Clone this repo and move inside the repo folder
2. Build your application with [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) (not required but easier for a quick test, in a real CD pipeline this can be done with anything producing a container image), example command:

	


```
skaffold build --default-repo PATH_OF_YOUR_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO \ 
--file-output=artifacts.json
```



3. Check that the` skaffold-helm` image has been created in your repository
4. Create a Cloud Deploy release for your application, this will also deploy your release in the `qa` environment, example command:


```
gcloud deploy releases create skaffold-helm --delivery-pipeline cd-on-gcp-pipeline \
--region YOUR_REGION --build-artifacts artifacts.json
```



5. In GCP Console - Cloud Deploy check that your rollout has completed in `qa` environment
6. On your `qa` cluster, check that you have the skaffold-helm deployment with 1 replica:


```
âžœ  ~ k get deploy
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
skaffold-helm   1/1     1            1           112s
```



7. In GCP Console - Cloud Deploy [Promote](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application#promoting_a_release) your release to the `prod` stage
8. In GCP Console - Cloud Deploy check that your rollout has completed in `prod` stage
9. On your prod cluster, check that you have the `skaffold-helm` deployment with 3 replicas:


```
k --context=prod-cluster get deploy
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
skaffold-helm   3/3     3            3           64s
```
